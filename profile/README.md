This repository represents the Nostalgia Rust, a 2017 Rust client that brings back the classical Rust with functioning EAC and old recoil.

Our client attempts to recreate how much everybody loved Rust in 2017. We are pretty aware that a lot of the Rust community miss the older design of the game, the old recoil mechanics, and this raw, really unfiltered way it had of playing. The idea of this project was to deliver a 2017 Rust client and servers with EAC and old recoil.
